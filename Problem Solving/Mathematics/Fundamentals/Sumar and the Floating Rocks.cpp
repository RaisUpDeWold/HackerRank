    So, to encounter another lattice point we must move a units in the y-direction and b units in the x-direction ...
    (x1 + b, y1 + a) is guaranteed to give us another lattice point because integers are being added and the slope is still the same.
    Number of lattice points = (y2 - y1)/a - 1 = (x2 - x1)/b - 1 ... Subtract 1 to exclude the destination.
    A further simplifaction can be made ... a = (y2 - y1)/gcd  and b = (x2 - x1)/gcd.
    Answer = gcd(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) - 1*/
